## How to get and start using Ferdi

### Download Ferdi

You can download Ferdi for Windows, Mac and Linux on [Ferdi's download page](https://getferdi.com/download) or you can find all variants in the [latest stable release](https://github.com/getferdi/ferdi/releases/latest) assets and [all the other releases here](https://github.com/getferdi/ferdi/releases).

### Or use Chocolatey (Windows only)

`$ choco install ferdi`

(Don't know Chocolatey? [chocolatey.org](https://chocolatey.org/))

### Or use Windows Package Manager (Windows only)

`$ winget install --id AmineMouafik.Ferdi`

(Don't know winget? [winget-cli](https://github.com/microsoft/winget-cli/))

### Or use homebrew (macOS or Linux)

`$ brew install --cask ferdi`

(Don't know homebrew? [brew.sh](https://brew.sh/))

### Or use snap (Linux only)

`$ snap install ferdi`

You can find published releases as `stable`, `beta` and `nightly` channels on [snapcraft.io](https://snapcraft.io/ferdi).

(Don't know snap? [snapcraft.io](https://snapcraft.io/))

### Or use AUR (Arch Linux)

Ferdi has three separate AUR packages you can use:

- **[ferdi](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/ferdi/)**: Uses your system electron version to run the latest release - this version will work best on most systems.
- **[ferdi-bin](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/ferdi-bin/)**: Uses the latest Fedora release and extracts it to Arch. Use this version if you are having trouble with the `ferdi` package.
- **[ferdi-git](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/ferdi-git/)**: Uses your system electron version to run the latest commit from the develop branch and may be unstable but may also give you features that are not yet available in other versions. Please only use `ferdi-git` if you accept these risks.

If you use an AUR Helper, e.g. yay, install it via `yay -S ferdi`.

## Contributing to Ferdi's development

We welcome all contributors. Please read the [contributing guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md) to setup your development machine and proceed.

## Nightly releases

Nightly releases are automatically triggered every day ([details](https://github.com/getferdi/ferdi/pull/990)) and available in [getferdi/ferdi](https://github.com/getferdi/ferdi/releases). Maintainers still need to verify and manually publish the draft releases as pre-releases for now.

## Troubleshooting recipes (self-help)

One of the issues being raised by the awesome users of Ferdi is that certain service-functionalities do not work. As good example of this is either the unread count (badge) stops working for specific services or the gmail logins don't work anymore. (These are just 2 of the most common problems reported).

Since we (the contributors to Ferdi) also eat our own dog food, we use Ferdi as our day-to-day communication app - and most likely have faced the same/similar issue. As a first step before filing an issue, we request you to follow these simple steps to see if the issue gets fixed. These recipes will get automatically upgraded when you upgrade to the newer versions of Ferdi, but to get new recipes **between** Ferdi releases, this documentation is quite useful.

- Make sure you are on the latest version of Ferdi. As of this writing, since the nightly CI packaging process is broken, we request you to download the latest nightly from the link in [Nightly releases](#nightly-releases) section.
- Stop Ferdi
- Navigate to the Ferdi profile folder in your respective installation in your file explorer application.

```bash
  Mac: ~/Library/Application Support/Ferdi/recipes
  Windows: %appdata%/Ferdi/recipes
  Linux: ~/.config/Ferdi/recipes
```

- Delete the folder of the service that is causing your issue - _in the file explorer application_. (Please note that if you have manually modified any files here, it will be your responsibility to merge the changes with the latest version of the recipe (or you can submit a [pull request](https://github.com/getferdi/recipes/pulls) for the same).
- Open a browser and navigate to the [recipes](https://github.com/getferdi/recipes/tree/master/recipes) repository page, and copy ALL the files for your erroneous service into your local machine at the location that you deleted in the previous step
- Restart Ferdi (this should upgrade your recipes to the latest working version that the contributors have fixed)
- If this process did not fix the issue, please log a detailed bug report [here](https://github.com/getferdi/recipes/issues)
- _Note:_ An automated process to perform these steps is being ideated and tracked [here](https://github.com/getferdi/ferdi/issues/1302)
